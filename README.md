# XMTP Skills

Skills for building with [XMTP](https://xmtp.org), the open protocol for secure, decentralized messaging between people and agents.

Skills are folders of instructions and resources that AI coding agents load dynamically to improve performance on specialized tasks. They follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) format.

## Available Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [xmtp-docs](./xmtp-docs) | Query XMTP documentation for current SDK patterns and methods |
| [xmtp-agent](./xmtp-agent) | Build a personal agent with its own XMTP identity using the CLI |

---

### xmtp-docs

Query current XMTP documentation to get accurate SDK patterns before writing code. The XMTP SDK evolves frequently—this skill ensures you're using current method names and signatures.

**Use when:**
- Looking up XMTP SDK methods or patterns
- Verifying current API signatures before coding
- Finding examples for streaming, consent, groups, or content types

**How it works:** Uses WebFetch to query specific documentation pages via `docs.xmtp.org/llms.txt` index

### xmtp-agent

Build a personal agent with its own identity on the XMTP network. Your agent can message people, join groups, and respond to conversations using the XMTP CLI.

**Use when:**
- Setting up an agent that messages people on XMTP
- Listening and responding to conversations as an agent
- Managing conversations and groups programmatically

**How it works:** Provides CLI setup, a bridge script for listening and responding (with OpenClaw), and a command reference for managing conversations

## Installation

### Claude Code

```bash
/install xmtp/skills
```

### Manual
